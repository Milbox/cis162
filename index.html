  <p> I am Melvin Rodriguez. I am a aspiring programmer who intends to learn programming well enough to take up some well paying programming jobs.
   I would also like to possibly make a indie game or project on the side with the knowledge I learn so I can make something I'm actually passionate about as well. For my freetime, however I usually
   walk my dog and play video games and such. Hopefully one day I can become a great programmer and help with large projects as well. </p>
